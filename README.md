# Group Fitness Tracking Application

# High Level Overview
* With our application, a user will be able to create a group calendar, add his friends to the group calendar, and then compete with others in the group by comparing how many times in a month everyone in the group went to the gym. Users will also be able to create a weekly workout schedule, and be able to search for exercises depending on their difficulty, muscle group, and the type of exercise. With the weather API, users will also be able to check whether or not they can go on a run on a specific day.
